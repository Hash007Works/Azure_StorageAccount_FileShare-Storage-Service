Created Fileshare after we created storage service bucket .
we added/ uploaded a file into fileshare ..
shared disk drive-  a drive will be available in all the computers which is hosted on your network
HashFileshare(fileshare_name) -- this fileshare i am gng to host on azure vm. now who ever is making logib into this vm, they can see this fileshare as a shared disk drive or shared disk..
once i have hosted this fileshare in azure vm then that vm we called it as file share server.
if the smb port(445) is opened , then only we can implement this fileshare storage service on azure vm
